### **1. Importance of Timely Delivery in Software Project Management**  
Timely delivery is critical because delays can lead to increased costs, missed business opportunities, and dissatisfied stakeholders.  

**How to Ensure Deadlines are Met:**  
- **Clear Project Scope:** Define goals and expectations early.  
- **Effective Planning:** Use project management tools (e.g., Jira, Trello).  
- **Agile Approach:** Break tasks into sprints to ensure incremental progress.  
- **Risk Management:** Identify potential roadblocks early.  
- **Team Accountability:** Regular stand-up meetings and progress tracking.  

### **2. Cost Control in Software Projects**  
Effective cost control ensures that a project remains within budget, preventing financial risks.  

**Strategies to Prevent Budget Overruns:**  
- **Accurate Estimation:** Use past data for realistic projections.  
- **Scope Management:** Avoid scope creep through proper documentation.  
- **Regular Monitoring:** Track expenses against the budget.  
- **Resource Optimization:** Allocate human and technical resources efficiently.  

### **3. Agile vs. Waterfall Methodologies**  

| Feature | Agile | Waterfall |
|---------|-------|----------|
| **Approach** | Iterative | Sequential |
| **Flexibility** | High – adapts to changes | Low – fixed scope |
| **Client Involvement** | Continuous feedback | Limited involvement |
| **Risk Management** | Identifies risks early | Risks discovered late |
| **Best for** | Dynamic projects | Well-defined projects |

### **4. When to Use Agile vs. Waterfall**  
- **Agile:** Best for projects requiring flexibility, like mobile apps, SaaS platforms.  
  - Example: A startup building an AI-driven chatbot.  
- **Waterfall:** Best for projects with fixed requirements, like regulatory software.  
  - Example: A government system for tax filing.  

### **5. Ensuring Quality Assurance in Software Projects**  
- **Automated Testing:** Catch bugs early (unit, integration, UI testing).  
- **Code Reviews:** Maintain coding standards.  
- **Continuous Integration/Deployment (CI/CD):** Frequent releases reduce errors.  
- **User Testing:** Gather feedback from real users.  

Maintaining high quality ensures better security, performance, and user satisfaction.  

### **6. Defining Project Scope & Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)**  
- **Project Scope:** Defines what’s included/excluded in the project.  
- **WBS:** Breaks a project into smaller tasks, making management easier.  

**Why is WBS Useful?**  
- Provides a clear roadmap.  
- Helps allocate resources efficiently.  
- Reduces project complexity.  

### **7. Benefits of a Detailed Project Schedule & Gantt Charts**  
- **Clear Timelines:** Helps track milestones.  
- **Improved Accountability:** Assigns responsibilities.  
- **Resource Allocation:** Prevents overloading teams.  

**How Gantt Charts Help:**  
- Visual representation of project timelines.  
- Tracks dependencies between tasks.  

### **8. Core Issues Your Software Aims to Address**  
- Lack of efficient service providers in local areas.  
- Limited access to verified professionals.  
- Inconvenience in booking services.  

**Why These Problems Matter:**  
- Users struggle to find trusted professionals.  
- Service providers lack a platform for exposure.  

### **9. Importance of Clearly Defining the Problem**  
A well-defined problem leads to:  
- A targeted solution.  
- Better user adoption.  
- Efficient resource utilization.  

### **10. Describing Your Software Solution Without Technical Jargon**
